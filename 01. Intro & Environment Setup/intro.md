# What is JavaScript?

    JavaScript is a high level, interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language that was Originally created to make web pages interactive, but today it is used far beyond the browser.

# What is Compiled language?

    When you write code, a compiler takes the whole program at once, converts it into machine code, and then runs it.
Think of it like translating an entire book into Hindi before you read it.


# What is Interpretation?

    Here, code is read and execute line by line. Like reading a book in English directly, sentence by sentence.

# What is Just-in-Time Compilation?

    Now, modern JavaScript engines like V8 (in Chrome, Node.JS) use a mix. They start by interpreting line by line, but at the same time, they optimize and compile frequently used parts of code for speed. So you get both flexibility and performance.
